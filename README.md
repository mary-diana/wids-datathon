 Participated in a competition(WIDS Datathon) that involved building a model to predict both an individual’s sex and their ADHD diagnosis using functional brain imaging data of children and adolescents and their socio-demographic, emotions, and parenting information.
 
 Challenge Question and Task: “What brain activity patterns are associated with ADHD; are they different between males and females, and, if so, how?”

The task is to create a multi-outcome model to predict two separate target variables: 1) ADHD (1=yes or 0=no) and 2) female (1=yes or 0=no).

As a result the accuracy score was 69%, beating more than 200 partcipants within the competition
